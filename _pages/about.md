I am a Project Assistant in the [Institute of Advancing Intelligence](https://www.tcgcrest.org/institutes/iai/) at [The Chatterjee Group Centre for Research & Education in Science & Technology (TCG CREST)](https://www.tcgcrest.org/). Here, I am working with, [Prof. Swagatam Das](https://www.isical.ac.in/~swagatam.das/). My research interests are in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, focusing on application of graph sectral approaches on computer vision, natural language processing, social networks.

Earlier I completed my Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Distinction with Honours in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata (QS rank: 601-650, NIRF rank: 4) under the guidance of [Prof. Amit Konar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=s1F23CAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Pratyusha Rakshit](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=00rPoQEAAAAJ). My undergraduate thesis was on object tracking using reinforcement learning from 2D videos. During my undergraduate degree, I also got the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects as a research intern at Robotics, Mechatronics, and Automation Laboratory (RMAL), Toronto Metropoliton University, sponsored by MITACS. .

I am always up for new collaborations, drop me an email at [majeearindam06072002[@]gmail[dot]com](mailto:majeearindam06072002@gmail.com) if you want to chat!
